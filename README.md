# 🖼️ Project 2 – Dynamic Image Gallery with JavaScript

Hey there again! 👋  
This is another project from the Cybersecurity Master's program — and this time, the challenge was a bit more dynamic: **"Build an image gallery using plain JavaScript (DOM) and CSS for styling"**.

## 💡 What does the gallery do?

Instead of writing the images directly in HTML, the idea was to **generate them dynamically through JavaScript** using the DOM.  
This allows for a cleaner structure and more flexible, scalable content management.

What it includes:

- Dynamic creation of each image from JS. 
- Optional titles or descriptions.
- Visual styling with CSS.
- Responsive layout (depending on screen size).

## ✨ Theme chosen: The Lord of the Rings

As a big fan of **The Lord of the Rings** 📖🎬 (both the books and the movies), I chose to base this gallery on that universe. The images, colors, and overall vibe are inspired by Middle-earth and its iconic characters.

## 🧠 What I practiced with this

- DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript.
- Dynamically adding elements (images, containers, etc.). 
- Keeping structure, styling, and logic well separated.
- Using `createElement`, `appendChild`, and class manipulation.
- Basic layout techniques with CSS grid or flexbox.

## 🛠 Technologies used

- **HTML5** – Basic structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript** – All gallery logic using the DOM

🚫 **Note:** This project was created as part of the master's program for educational purposes and to keep improving my JavaScript and layout skills.

It also gave me the perfect excuse to pay tribute to one of my favorite worlds: Middle-earth. 🌄🧙‍♂️🗡️
